Usage guide:
    We worked hard to make our interface and visualizations intuitive. 
Navigate to pages using either the left and right arrows on the sides
of each page or by clicking on the navigation bar at the top.
    When visualization interaction isn't intuitive, we explain how to
interact explicitly, for example telling people to scroll both vertically 
and horizontally on the carbon inequality page.
