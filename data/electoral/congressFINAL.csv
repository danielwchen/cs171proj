In 2009 he questioned the validity of climate science research saying: Taxpayer funded research by NASA and the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) concerning the warmest years on record has been the subject of dispute and after challenges, has been changed and re-released. What is less known is why the changes were made and what inherent flaws existed in the original data, if any. It is important to understand the reasons behind these alterations and further to avoid suspicion that data was massaged to fit the prescribed theory that global warming is attributable to man-made greenhouse gas emissions. And he remains skeptical of the science behind global climate change. In a recent op-ed he said ""climate models fail"" and argued that policies aimed at addressing climate change do more harm than good.","Cornyn, 12/16/09 ||| National Review, 7/20/15",http://www.cornyn.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?p=NewsReleases&ContentRecord_id=4d678d77-cf3a-483d-b55a-426830c34b42&ContentType_id=b94acc28-404a-4fc6-b143-a9e15bf92da4&Group_id=24eb5606-e2db-4d7f-bf6c-efc5df80b676&MonthDisplay=12&YearDisplay=2009 ||| http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421397/climate-change-policy-american-innovationJohn Fleming,5-Jul-51,15-Dec-16,65,M,2182 Rayburn HOB; Washington DC 20515-1804,https://fleming.house.gov/contact/contactform.htm,http://fleming.house.gov,202-225-2777,Republican,6-Jan-09,3-Jan-17,7,57,LA,Louisiana,5,2182 Rayburn House Office Building,rep,2018,No,"So after all of these years and all of this policy and now cost to government and to free enterprise, to private businesses and individuals we actually find out that all of that policy is based on what perhaps one could say is voodoo science.","House Committee on Natural Resources hearing, 5/13/15 via The Guardian",http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2015/may/21/congress-manufactures-doubt-and-denial-in-climate-change-hearingJohn Garamendi,24-Jan-45,15-Dec-16,71,M,2438 Rayburn HOB; Washington DC 20515-0503,https://garamendi.house.gov/contact-me/email-me,http://garamendi.house.gov,202-225-1880,Democratic,3-Nov-09,3-Jan-17,7,64,CA,California,4,2438 Rayburn House Office Building,rep,2018,Yes,,,John Hoeven,13-Mar-57,15-Dec-16,59,M,338 Russell Senate Office Building Washington DC 20510,http://www.hoeven.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/email-the-senator,https://www.hoeven.senate.gov,202-224-2551,Republican,5-Jan-11,3-Jan-17,5,53,ND,North Dakota,,338 Russell Senate Office Building,sen,2022,No,"Well, the science shows that there's warming.
