            Clean, accessible water for all is an essential part of the world we want to live in. There is
            sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. But due to bad economics or poor
            infrastructure, every year millions of people, most of them children, die from diseases
            associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene. Water scarcity, poor water
            quality and inadequate sanitation negatively impact food security, livelihood choices and
            educational opportunities for poor families across the world. Drought afflicts some of the
            world’s poorest countries, worsening hunger and malnutrition.

            <h4>Population growth and rural-urban migration</h4>
            Africa’s rising population is driving demand for water and accelerating the degradation of
            water resources in many countries on the continent. Among developing regions, Sub-Saharan
            Africa is estimated to have the highest prevalence of urban slums and it is expected to
            double to around 400 million by 2020. Despite the efforts of some Sub-Saharan African
            countries and cities to expand basic services and improve urban housing conditions. Rapid
            and unplanned urban growth has increased the number of settlements on unstable,
            flood-prone, and high-risk land where phenomena such as landslides, rains, and earthquakes
            have devastating consequences.

            <h4>Economic development and poverty</h4>
            Sub-Saharan Africa is the world’s poorest and least developed region, with half its population
            living on less than a dollar a day. About two-thirds of its countries rank among the lowest in
            the Human Development Index. Even when opportunities exist to address outstanding water
            issues, deep and widespread poverty across the African region constrains the ability of many
            cities and communities to provide proper water and sanitation services, sufficient water for
            economic activities and to prevent water quality from deteriorating.

        <h2>What can we do?</h2>
        Civil society organizations should work to keep governments accountable, invest in water
        research and development, and promote the inclusion of women, youth and indigenous
        communities in water resources governance.
        Generating awareness of these roles and turning them into action will lead to win-win results
        and increased sustainability and integrity for both human and ecological systems.
